# zius

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **OpenAPI** - REST access to the same procedures, with a Scalar reference
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database (optional):

```bash
bun run db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## REST API and OpenAPI

Every expense, expense group and person procedure is also reachable as REST. The routes are
generated from the tRPC procedures themselves via `trpc-to-openapi`, so there is one
implementation and one set of tests behind both transports.

| Surface           | Local                                | Deployed             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| REST routes       | `http://localhost:3000/v1/*`         | `/api/v1/*`          |
| OpenAPI document  | `http://localhost:3000/openapi.json` | `/api/openapi.json`  |
| Scalar reference  | `http://localhost:3000/docs`         | `/api/docs`          |

Requests authenticate with the same Better-Auth session as tRPC — send the session cookie
with `credentials: "include"`, or an `Authorization: Bearer` token from clients that cannot
hold cookies.

To expose a new procedure, add `.meta({ openapi: { method, path } })` and an `.output()` Zod
schema to it. Procedures without both are served over tRPC only, which is why the `todo`
scaffold does not appear in the document.

The document advertises the base callers reach the server through. Behind the Vercel rewrite
the `/api` prefix is stripped before the request arrives, so `SERVER_PUBLIC_URL` carries it;
it defaults to `<deployment origin>/api` on Vercel and needs no local value.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@zius/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment

### Vercel Services

- Target: web + server
- Config: `vercel.json`
- Link the project first: bun run deploy:setup
- Local Vercel dev: bun run dev:vercel
- Sync preview env: bun run env:preview
- Sync production env: bun run env:production
- Dry-run check (no upload): bun run deploy:check
- Preview deploy: bun run deploy
- Production deploy: bun run deploy:prod
- Web requests under `/api/*` route to the server service and are rewritten before reaching the backend.
  Vercel Services share project environment variables, but deploys do not upload local `.env` files automatically. Link the project with `vercel link`, then run the env sync command before your first deploy (otherwise the deployment starts with no env vars), or pass one-off envs with `vercel deploy -e KEY=value`.
  Pass Vercel CLI flags to the env sync command directly, for example: `bun run env:production --scope your-team`.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Vercel](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/vercel).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`
